\Abstract{
  As the world main economic forum, the political commitment of G20 leaders is built to solve many challenges of global economic growth, one of which is corruption eradication (Sherpa G20 Indonesia, 2018). The G20 Anti-Corruption Working Group (ACWG) that was established in 2010 is expected to overcome corruption in G20. In fact, decrease in corruption followed by decrease in economic growth. Besides that, dualism views from the impact of corruption on economic growth is often a debate, as “sand the wheels” or “grease the wheels”. This study aimed to examine simultaneous relationship among corruption and economic growth as well as factors that influence it in G20 countries in 2010-2016 by using simultaneous equations model. The estimation method that used is Error Component Two-Stage Least Square (EC2SLS). The results show that there is a negative simultaneous relationship among corruption and economic growth, also confirms “sand the wheels” view. In addition, investment and number of workers has a positive effect on economic growth. On the other hand, inflation has a positive effect on corruption while the percentage of urban population and regulatory quality has a negative effect on corruption.

Manuscripts submitted without considering the AJS style file will be very likely not sent into review, but declined with possibility for re-submission.

\section{Introduction}


The style file of the Austrian Journal of Statsitics is based on the style file of the Journal of Statistical Software (JSS) including minor modifications. We thank Achim Zeileis for his great work on the JSS style file.

The Austrian Journal of Statistics is freely available over the net. Free and open-source tools used for production of your manuscript are therefore also highly supported. Code to reproduce the figures and tables in manuscripts as well as methods implemented in software can be published as supplementary material. This increases usually the number of 
downloads of your article.

After review, final sources can also be sent as \texttt{Sweave} \citep[see, e.g.,][]{leisch02} or \texttt{knitr} \citep{yihui13} .Rnw files.

%Graphics should be inserted as PostScript files using the
%package {\tt psfig} or {\tt graphicx}. Bibliographic references
%should be given using {\tt bibtex} in the {\em author-date\/}
%style.


\section{Writing your manuscript}

The Journal is produced on the basis of computer readable
manuscripts provided by the authors. 


In order to obtain a uniform layout and to ease the production as
much as possible it is highly recommended to use \LaTeXe\ for the
text processing. 

Each article must have a summary in English which
inform the reader quickly on the contents and the substantial
results. The length surely depends on the contents. 
Mathematical formulas and references should be
avoided in the summary.

Headings and footings as well as pagination will be added during
the production. Footnotes should be avoided.

The article should be structured by enumerated sections and
subsections. The title should be in title case style, sections and subsections in section case style. Graphics and tables must contain captions, above
tables and below graphics (figures). Examples are (see Figure~\ref{Fig3.4} and Table~\ref{Tab3.4}).
Graphics \textbf{should be produced in \textbf{pdf} format} and included 
 at suitable places of the manuscript.

\end{table}

Mathematical formulas should be enumerated as far as they are
referenced \textbf{only}. E.g.~Equation~(\ref{form3.1}) shows the density 
\begin{equation}\label{form3.1}
f(x) =
\frac1{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}\,.
\end{equation}

Please consider 

\begin{itemize}
\item  capitalized title case for titles and for all references and 
\item sentence, non-capitalized case for sections and subsections.
\end{itemize}


Cited literature should be summarized at the end of the article in
form of a non-enumerated section. \cite{leisch02} is a reference
to an article. If the citation is in parentheses, it
should look like \citep{leisch02}.
References should be in title case.

Correspondence addresses of author(s) should be added at the end
of the manuscript. 


\section{Submission and refereeing}


\subsection{Submission}

Consideration of the previously stated rules are of great help for
the editing process. Whenever technically possible, manuscripts
should be submitted through the editorial system at \href{www.ajs.or.at}{www.ajs.or.at}. The authors must be registered at this website.

\subsection{Refereing}

All contributions will be anonymously refereed. Cited literature which is
hardly available should accompany the submitted manuscript. It
should also be considered to place used and analyzed data at
disposal for the referees (if there are no legal or technical
arguments against).

Editor and referees must trust that the contribution has not been
submitted for publication at the same time at another place. It is
fair that the submitting author notifies if an earlier version has
already been submitted somewhere before.

\subsection{Copyrights and fees}

The Austrian Journal of Statistics is free of
charge. Generally, we use the Creative Commons Attribution License (CC-BY).

For copyright issues, publication ethics and malpractice statements, please have a look at 
\href{www.ajs.or.at}{www.ajs.or.at}


\section{Checklist}

We list the most common mistakes when submitting manuscripts to the journal and formulate them in form of questions.

\begin{itemize}
\item Did you upload a pdf of your manuscript for review? (no Word, no .tex, ...)
\item Did you use the style of AJS?  
\item Are your graphics produced in pdf format? 
\item Is your title captialized?
\item Are the titles of your cited papers in your references capitalized?
\item Are your section and subsection headers non-capitalized form?
\item Are your tables produced with \LaTeX ? (no screenshots)
\item Have you cited the software you used, e.g. R itself and R packages used? To not cite software is plagiarism and violates intellectual properties of the authors of the software.
\item Did you proposed at least three independent reviewers?
\end{itemize}

\section{Frequently asked questions}

\noindent 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{My citation shows all authors and not the typically shown et al.}. \\ Answer: this is ok. We like to show all authors in the text.
\item \textit{When I submit a paper, how long does it take to be published} \\ Answer: The average time from submission to publication is approx. 165 days. But it heavily depends if you can make satisfying revisions in time. 
\item \textit{In which databases is AJS indexed.} \\
Answer: we are indexed in many of them, most notable is Scopus (from Elsevier). More information can be found at the website of AJS. 
\item \textit{Can I upload my paper on \href{https://arxiv.org/}{https://arxiv.org/} and distribute before the paper is online at AJS? } \\
Answer: Of course, you can do it. However, please clearly point out in the header of the paper that this paper is under review in the Austrian Journal of Statistics and will likely be published there. Note that the readers should check if the paper is already be published at AJS for correct citation, i.e. finally the journal should be cited. Update and upload  \href{https://arxiv.org/}{https://arxiv.org/} or similar sites with the final version in AJS style after the paper is published  in AJS.
